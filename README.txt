Zune Game Development using XNA 3.0
Sample Code README
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This download contains the example code for the Apress title: 
Zune Game Development using XNA 3.0.

HOW TO USE THESE EXAMPLES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When you find an exercise in the book that you'd like to try 
out, you can open the corresponding solution file found in this
download. The paths to use are referenced in the book, but the 
naming convention is straightforward: Look in the appropriate
chapter folder for the exercise and you should find everything 
you need to follow along.

FINDING ARTWORK
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Artwork for an exercise can be found in one of two places:
   1) in the exercise directory,
   2) in the chapter directory.

In some cases you will find artwork in 
    ChapterXX\Exercise YY\Artwork

In other cases you will find artwork in
    ChapterXX\Artwork

You will need these original artwork files to build most of
the examples, although you can always images in your
solution with an image of the same size and format.

BUILDING WITH THE BOOK
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In most cases, you will be provided with the final, working
example for the exercise. The book will walk you through the
construction of each program from the ground up, so you can
(and should) use a brand new solution first to try it out.

WHERE TO GET HELP
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
First, try the XNA forums at http://forums.xna.com
Google/Live Search is also a good bet for many common problems.

Because the book is so detailed, some problems can be solved
simply by re-reading the exercise to ensure you haven't missed
a slightly obscured step somewhere.

cannot guarantee a response due to the volume of inquiries.
